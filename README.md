# What is Mixed Reality Toolkit - Unreal?

The Mixed Reality Toolkit for Unreal (MRTK-Unreal) is a set of components, in the form of plugins, samples and documentation, designed to help development of Mixed Reality applications using the [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/).

In this repository you can find information about the current components of this toolkit. Please follow the relevant links in this page to access the code and documentation of each individual component.

Currently the toolkit consists of the [UX Tools for Unreal](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-UXTools-Unreal), providing code, blueprints and examples to implement UX features for Hololens 2 applications.

We’d recommend taking a look at the [Frequently Asked Questions](FAQ.md) and the [Further Documentation](#further-documentation) section.
