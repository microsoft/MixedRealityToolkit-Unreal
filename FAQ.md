# Frequently Asked Questions

## Where can I download MRTK-Unreal?

MRTK-Unreal is not a single package. You can download and use each component in MRTK-Unreal individually. The first component being made available is [UX Tools for Unreal](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-UXTools-Unreal).

## Where can I learn more about Unreal / Mixed Reality / HoloLens 2 Development?

Please take a look at our Documentation Links.

## What platforms and devices does MRTK-Unreal support?

Different components may support different platform/device combinations. In general, support for HoloLens 2 development is the primary priority but the long term goal is to support Mixed Reality development for different devices and platforms, using the platform abstractions available in Unreal Engine and complementing those when necessary.

Note that Unreal Engine does not support HoloLens 1 devices.

## What versions of Unreal Engine are supported

You need UE 4.23.0 or later to develop for HoloLens 2, and UE.25.0 or later to use any component in MRTK-Unreal.

Please refer to the documentation for each [component](README.md#MRTK-Unreal-Components) for more specific details.

## How does MRTK-Unreal relate to [MRTK-Unity](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity)?

Both projects provide developers with additional tools to develop Mixed Reality applications using their engine of choice, and both efforts are being driven and developed by the same teams in Microsoft.

Architecturally, they differ in the fact that MRTK-Unity is an actual Unity plugin containing a large set of features, while MRTK-Unreal is being developed as a set of independent plugins, each focused on a reduced feature set. 

In terms of maturity, MRTK-Unreal is at a far earlier stage than MRTK-Unity: for most components, breaking changes between releases are expected, as new features, use cases and platforms are accommodated. 

## Do you accept contributions?

Please refer to the contribution guidelines of each [component](README.md#MRTK-Unreal-Components) in MRTK-Unreal. We always welcome bug reports, suggestions and feature requests. We would also love to see what you create with it!

Generally, we are not in a position to accept code contributions due to the early stage of the project and the likelihood of breaking changes and code conflicts arising with changes being developed internally by Microsoft and/or Epic.

## I’ve created some content using MRTK-Unreal, would you like to see it?
